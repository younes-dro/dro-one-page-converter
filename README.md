- **2**:  set it as FrontPage  :  

> (Settings -> reading -> static page ).

- **3**: create a set of pages that you want to display on the home page (or already existing pages) and define them as child pages of the FrontPage.The menu is dynamically built and contains the titles of the child pages.
